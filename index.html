      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Selective redaction is a desirable property of verifiable credentials.
        OpenAttestation implements a lossy progressive selective redaction
        scheme, which allows it to be used in applications where a verifiable
        credential is passed along a chain of multiple verifiers and where
        privacy and data minimization techniques are desired and/or required.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>OpenAttestation</h3>
        <p>
          OpenAttestation is an open-source framework for implementing
          verifiable credentials. It has been used in production:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For educational institutions to issue
            <a href="https://www.opencerts.io/">academic credentials</a> to
            graduates;
          </li>
          <li>
            For healthcare clinics to issue
            <a href="https://www/healthcerts.gov.sg/"
              >COVID-19 pre-departure test and vaccination records</a
            >
            in line with international standards and the Singapore government.

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This section describes an example use case of OpenAttestation verifiable credentials, in
            cross-border trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            The verifiable credential may be passed to multiple parties in the
            supply chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Along the chain, parties may wish to redact sensitive information
            before passing to the next party.
          </li>
          <li>
            This use case requires a lossy progressive disclosure scheme that
            does not break the original signature.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2><dfn data-dfn-for="producing">Producing</dfn></h2>
      <p>
        There are 2 main methods to issuing or signing a Verifiable Credential
        with OpenAttestationMerkleProof2018:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Issuing onto a [= documentStore/document store =] (a smart contract on
          the Ethereum network that records the issuance and revocation status
          of OpenAttestation documents); or
        </li>
        <li>Signing with a decentralised identifier (DID)</li>
      </ol>
      <section>
        <h3><dfn data-dfn-for="wrapping">Wrapping</dfn></h3>
        <p>
          To generate an OpenAttestationMerkleProof2018 signature, the raw
          document first goes through a process we call [= wrapping =]. In this
          process, salts are generated for every property of the credential
          object in order to prevent rainbow table attack. They are then
          flattened and encoded as a string and embedded in
          <code>proof.salts</code> (<a
            href="https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-verify/blob/edeccf6b4c4613dc43c4eb7a0d97fce4897cad93/test/fixtures/v3/did-wrapped.json#L64"
            >see example</a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the [= rawDocument/raw document =] has been salted, each field
          will be hashed with the value and salt. The output hashes will then be
          sorted and stored in an array.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, with the array of sorted hashes, the stringified array is
          hashed again and embedded in <code>proof.targetHash</code> and
          <code>proof.merkleRoot</code> (same if only 1 raw document is wrapped
          at a time).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Issued onto the Document Store</h3>
        <p>
          For issued Verifiable Credentials, the
          <code>proof.merkleRoot</code> is written into the [=
          documentStore/document store =].

      <h2>Cryptography Suites and Libraries</h2>
      <p>
        The OpenAttestation implementation of the algorithm described above uses
        the <code>keccak256</code> hash to transform properties into the
        <code>targetHash</code>, and ECDSA with Secp256k1 to sign the
        <code>targetHash</code>. However, the algorithm is not permanently tied
        to these cryptography suites. In the event that they fall to new attacks
        and technology advances, this specification will be updated to upgrade
        the cryptography suites used.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Redacting</h2>
      <p>
        To obfuscate a property in the OpenAttestation Verifiable Credential,
        the key-value pair is hashed and the resulting hash is stored in the
        <code>privacy.obfuscatedData property</code>. The obfuscated object is
        removed. This method can be used to obfuscate multiple key-value pairs
        in the credential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obfuscation does not invalidate the <code>proof</code> property as the
        <code>targetHash</code> is computed over all hashed key-value pairs in
        the credential.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Verifying</h2>
      <p>
        To verify the integrity of the document, the verifier computes the
        <code>targetHash</code> via the same process in [= producing/Producing
        =], namely by hashing individual key-value pairs, appending and sorting
        the hashes of the individual key-value pairs with the hashes from
        <code>privacy.obfuscatedData</code>, and computing the
        <code>targetHash</code> from the array of sorted hashes. The verifier
        then checks that the computed hash matches the <code>targetHash</code>.
        Where the <code>targetHash</code> is signed with the issuer's DID, the
        verifier utilises the DID verification method to verify the signature.
